A throwback game from my childhood, but coded!

Skills Used:
- javascript
- jQuey
- DOM manipulation

How to use:
- Load up the code on a live server and press any key to start

How to play:
- As you play, you need to remember the order that the game lights up a colour in
- Each level, you must recreate that pattern while adding on the new colour that was lit up
